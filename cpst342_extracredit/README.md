Thoughts: I actually really enjoyed this assignment. I learned a lot about React and am going to further studying it because I think it's a very great tool. I wasn't able to get a chance to integrate dynamic data.

Assignment: I decided to change my links to "Sciences" to show experiments and "Art" to show.. well art.

I think the style looks much better now and I think the ability to create components was such an amazing feature of this. I really enjoyed this extra credit assignment.

To run: 

simply run 'npm start' in the folder where you have the package.json.

Or just navigate to the link given that's hosted on github pages.
